## **Recently I got the requirement to create  a text in SO10 and create a FM and then pass values in it dynamically.**
## Standard FMs used inside**
* READ_TEXT
* SET_TEXTSYMBOL_PROGRAM
* REPLACE_TEXTSYMBOL

## Text I have created in SO10 is 
* Dear &Z_NAME&, You have a missed call from &Z_PHN&. The last missed call
* was at &Z_TIME& on &Z_DATE& .
* Thankyou, Team Jio.

## Debugging Screenshot-
 * READ TEXT - Got the required text in Internal table

 * Here we are checking how many text symbola are found by using counter variable as **lt_count** and to replace it in **lt_text_replace**.

    The SEARCH statement looks through the **lt_text table** to find the string **lv_concat**. If found, it sets a **mark (sy-subrc = 0)**.

   The below line performs the actual replacement of the placeholder in the lt_text_replace table. RESPECTING CASE ensures that the replacement is case-sensitive.

**REPLACE ALL OCCURRENCES OF lv_concat
     IN TABLE lt_text_replace[] WITH ' '
     RESPECTING CASE.**

* **SET_TEXTSYMBOL_PROGRAM** - Prepares the program specified by prog_name to handle text symbols during form processing. The event parameter specifies the event (in this case, 'OPEN_fORM') during which the text symbols should be processed.

* **REPLACE_TEXTSYMBOL** - Perform the actual replacement of text symbols in the specified text.
